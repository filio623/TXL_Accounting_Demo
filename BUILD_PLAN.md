# TXL Accounting Demo - Build Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress and plans for the TXL Accounting Demo project. It serves as a living document that will be updated as we progress through the development phases.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality ✅
1. Data Models (src/models/) ✅
   - ✅ `account.py`: Chart of accounts data structure
   - ✅ `transaction.py`: Transaction data structure

2. Input Processing (src/data/) ✅
   - ✅ `input_processor.py`: Handle CSV/Excel file reading

3. Core Matching Engine (src/matching/) ✅
   - ✅ `matcher.py`: Base matching interface
   - ✅ `rule_matcher.py`: Rule-based matching logic

4. Output Generation (src/data/) ✅
   - ✅ `output_generator.py`: Generate enriched CSV/Excel output

### Phase 2: Persistence & Enhancement
1. Persistence Layer (src/persistence/) ⏳
   - ⏳ `mapping_store.py`: Store successful matches
   - ⏳ `rule_store.py`: Store matching rules

2. Enhanced Rule Matching ⏳
   - This will build upon the basic rule matching in Phase 1

3. Initial Confidence Scoring ⏳
   - ⏳ `confidence.py`: Calculate match confidence (file exists but empty)

### Phase 3: AI Integration
1. AI/LLM Integration (src/matching/) ⏳
   - ⏳ `llm_matcher.py`: LLM-based matching logic (file exists but empty)

2. Advanced Confidence Scoring ⏳
   - This will build upon the basic confidence scoring from Phase 2

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
1. Performance Optimization ⏳
   - This will be ongoing throughout development

2. Error Handling 🔄
   - Basic error handling implemented, needs enhancement

3. User Interface Improvements ⏳
   - This will be ongoing throughout development

### Utilities (src/utils/) 🔄
- 🔄 `helpers.py`: Common utility functions
  - Basic utilities implemented, more to be added as needed

## Current Status
- ✅ Completed: 6 components
- 🔄 In Progress: 2 components
- ⏳ Pending: 7 components

## Next Steps
1. Implement confidence scoring
2. Begin Phase 2: Implement persistence layer
   - Create `mapping_store.py` for storing successful matches
   - Create `rule_store.py` for storing matching rules

## Legend
- ✅ Completed
- 🔄 In Progress
- ⏳ Pending

## Notes
- This document will be updated as we progress through the development
- Each component's status will be updated when changes are made
- Additional notes or requirements will be added as needed
- Phase 1 is now complete! 🎉
- Testing coverage has been improved across all Phase 1 components
