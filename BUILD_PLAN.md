# TXL Accounting Demo - Build Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress and plans for the TXL Accounting Demo project. It serves as a living document that will be updated as we progress through the development phases.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality ✅
1. Data Models (src/models/) ✅
   - ✅ `account.py`: Chart of accounts data structure
   - ✅ `transaction.py`: Transaction data structure

2. Input Processing (src/data/) ✅
   - ✅ `input_processor.py`: Handle CSV/Excel file reading

3. Core Matching Engine (src/matching/) ✅
   - ✅ `matcher.py`: Base matching interface
   - ✅ `rule_matcher.py`: Rule-based matching logic

4. Output Generation (src/data/) ✅
   - ✅ `output_generator.py`: Generate enriched CSV/Excel output

### Phase 2: Persistence & Enhancement
1. Persistence Layer (src/persistence/) ✅
   - ✅ `mapping_store.py`: Store successful matches (JSON implementation complete)
   - ✅ `rule_store.py`: Store matching rules (JSON implementation complete)

2. Enhanced Rule Matching 🔄
   - 🔄 Implement mapping-first logic in `RuleMatcher`
   - ⏳ Address ambiguous mappings (e.g., same description, different accounts)
   - ⏳ Add other heuristics/enhancements

3. Initial Confidence Scoring ✅
   - ✅ `confidence.py`: Calculate match confidence (basic implementation complete)

### Phase 3: AI Integration
1. AI/LLM Integration (src/matching/) 🔄
   - 🔄 `llm_matcher.py`: LLM-based matching logic (Basic structure created, model set to gpt-4o-mini)
   - ⏳ Implement actual LLM API calls and parsing
   - ⏳ Refine LLM prompt engineering

2. Advanced Confidence Scoring ⏳
   - This will build upon the basic confidence scoring from Phase 2

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
1. Performance Optimization ⏳
   - This will be ongoing throughout development

2. Error Handling 🔄
   - Basic error handling implemented, needs enhancement

3. User Interface Improvements ⏳
   - This will be ongoing throughout development

### Utilities (src/utils/) 🔄
- 🔄 `helpers.py`: Common utility functions
  - Basic utilities implemented, more to be added as needed

## Current Status
- ✅ Completed: 9 components
- 🔄 In Progress: 4 components
- ⏳ Pending: 4 components

## Next Steps
1. Implement mapping-first logic in `RuleMatcher` (part of Enhanced Rule Matching)
2. Enhance confidence scoring logic (e.g., consider amount, type)
3. Flesh out `LLMMatcher` implementation (API calls, parsing)

## Legend
- ✅ Completed
- 🔄 In Progress
- ⏳ Pending

## Notes
- This document will be updated as we progress through the development
- Each component's status will be updated when changes are made
- Additional notes or requirements will be added as needed
- Phase 1 is now complete! 🎉
- Testing coverage has been improved across all Phase 1 components
- Basic confidence scoring implemented and integrated into RuleMatcher.
- Rule persistence implemented using `RuleStore` (JSON).
- Mapping persistence implemented using `MappingStore` (JSON).
- Current enhancement: Adding mapping-first check to `RuleMatcher`. Known limitation: simple mapping cannot handle same description mapping to multiple accounts; solution deferred.
- Basic structure for `LLMMatcher` created using `gpt-4o-mini` as default.
